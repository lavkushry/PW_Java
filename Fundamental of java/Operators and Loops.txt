1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Ans:Conditional Operators in Java: The conditional operators in Java are && (Logical AND), || (Logical OR), and ! (Logical NOT).

2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans: Types of operators based on the number of operands: There are three types - Unary (one operand, e.g., ++x), Binary (two operands, e.g., x+y), and Ternary (three operands, e.g., x ? y : z).

3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
Ans:Use of Switch case in Java programming: The switch case is used for decision making in Java. It allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

4. What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java?
Ans: Priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java: The priority levels, from highest to lowest, are: Parentheses, Unary operators, Multiplication/Division/Modulus, Addition/Subtraction.

5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Ans: Conditional Statements in Java: Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The conditional statements in Java are: if, if-else, else-if, switch.


6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans:
if(condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true

  // code to be executed if condition is false
}

7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
Ans: The 3 types of iterative statements in Java: The three types of loops in Java are for, while, and do-while.

8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
Ans:Difference between for loop and do-while loop: A for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly. A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, except that the condition is checked at the end of the loop, so the loop will always run at least once.


9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Ans:
for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
