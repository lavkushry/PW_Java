1. What is the Collection framework in Java?
Ans: The Collection framework in Java provides a set of interfaces and classes to implement data structures. It includes classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and TreeSet, and interfaces like List, Set, and Queue.

2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Ans : ArrayList and LinkedList both implement the List interface. ArrayList is backed by an array and provides constant-time positional access. LinkedList is implemented as a doubly linked list and provides efficient add and remove operations at the beginning or end.

3. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
ANS: Iterator and ListIterator are both interfaces in the Collection framework. Iterator can traverse in forward direction only, while ListIterator can traverse a List in both directions (forward and backward).

4. What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Ans: Iterator and Enumeration both are interfaces for traversing over elements of a Collection. Iterator allows the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics, while Enumeration does not.

5. What is the difference between List and Set?
Ans: List and Set both are interfaces in the Collection framework. List is an ordered collection and can contain duplicate elements. Set is an unordered collection of unique elements

6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
Ans:HashSet and TreeSet both implement the Set interface. HashSet stores elements in a hashtable and does not maintain any order, while TreeSet stores elements in a Red-Black tree and orders its elements based on their values.

7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Ans: Array is a fixed-length data structure while ArrayList is a variable-length Collection class. Unlike Array, ArrayList provides more flexibility and functionality like dynamic resizing.
