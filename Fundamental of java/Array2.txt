1. What is the default value of Array for different data types?
Ans:The default value of an array in Java depends on the type of its elements:

For int[], short[], byte[], long[], float[], double[], the default value is 0.
For char[], the default value is \u0000.
For boolean[], the default value is false.
For Object[] or any array containing non-primitive data types, the default value is null.

2. Can you pass the negative number in Array size?
Ans:No, you cannot pass a negative number as an array size in Java. Doing so will throw a NegativeArraySizeException at runtime.

3. Where does Array stored in JVM memory ?
ans:In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), arrays are stored in the heap memory.

4. What are the disadvantages of Array?
Ans:Disadvantages of arrays in Java include:

The size of an array is fixed at the time of creation and cannot be changed dynamically.
Arrays do not provide built-in methods for common operations like searching and sorting.

5. What is an Anonymous Array in Java? Give an example?
Ans:An anonymous array in Java is an array without a name that is declared and initialized in the same statement. For example:
int sum = sum(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}); // Here, new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is an anonymous array

6. What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java?
Ans:There are several ways to traverse an array in Java, including:

Using a traditional for loop
Using a for-each loop
Using an iterator (for collections)
Using streams (Java 8 and later)

7. What is the difference between length and length() method Give an Examples?
Ans:
length is a property of an array that returns the number of elements in the array. length() is a method of the String class that returns the number of characters in a string. For example:
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(arr.length); // Outputs 3

String str = "Hello";
System.out.println(str.length()); // Outputs 5
