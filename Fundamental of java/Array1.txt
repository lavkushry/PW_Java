1.  What do you mean by an Array?
    Ans: An array is a data structure in programming that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. It is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

2.  How to create an Array?
    Ans: int[] myArray = new int[5]; // Creates an array of integers with a size of 5

3.  Can we change the size of an array at run time?
    Ans: No, we cannot change the size of an array at runtime in Java. Once an array is created, its size is fixed.

4.  Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
    Ans: In Java, you cannot declare an array without specifying its size or without initializing it. However, you can initialize an array without specifying its size like this:
    int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Creates an array of integers and initializes it
5.  What is the default value of Array?
    Ans:The default value of an array depends on the type of its elements. For example, the default value is 0 for an array of integers, false for an array of booleans, and null for an array of objects.

6.  What is a 1D array with an example?
    Ans: A 1D array is a simple list of elements. Here's an example in Java:
    int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // This is a 1D array
7.  Write a program on a 2D array?
    Ans:
    Here's a simple program that creates and prints a 2D array in Java:
    public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[][] myArray = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
    }; // This is a 2D array

            // Print the 2D array
            for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < myArray[i].length; j++) {
                    System.out.print(myArray[i][j] + " ");
                }
                System.out.println();
            }
        }

    }
